### New Portfolio - 2022 August

Playing around with portfolio allocations, I found a new one that I liked:
- 22% TSM (Total Stock Market)
- 23% SCV (Small-cap Value)
- 10% LTT (Long-term Treasuries)
- 25% REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)
- 20% GLD (Gold)

You can plug those numbers into the [PortfolioCharts.com](https://portfoliocharts.com/) tools:
- the [My Portfolio](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/my-portfolio/) tool to see its stats

- or the [Portfolio Matrix](https://portfoliocharts.com/portfolio/portfolio-matrix/)
to compare it against other portfolios

.

Here are some highlights vs. Golden Butterfly:

| Metrics                                             | New Portfolio | Golden Butterfly |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------:|-----------------:|
| Minimum 30-year PWR<br/>(Perpetual Withdrawal Rate) |          5.9% |             5.1% |
| Baseline Long-Term Return                           |          6.8% |             5.6% |
| Average Return                                      |          8.2% |             6.3% |
| Ulcer index                                         |           5.2 |              2.5 |

I wanted to explore alternatives to the Golden Butterfly portfolio with reduced exposure to Long-Term Treasuries
(see Ray Dalio's article: [Why in the World Would You Own Bonds When...](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio/)).

I found REIT turned out to be a strong asset to include.

And surprisingly, this new portfolio entirely dropped the "cash" asset, STT (Short-term Treasuries),
yet its 10-year minimum PWR was 4%, as high as Golden Butterfly!

Here are a few screenshots showing the new portfolio's performance:

ranking the portfolios by Perpetual Withdrawal Rate:

Its standard deviation ranking is lower, but I don't mind the increased volatility, 
especially when the ulcer score is still so low.

Here's a tall screenshot comparing the new portfolio on the left, to the Golden Butterfly portfolio on the right:
